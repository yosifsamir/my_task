- add "Flutter_localizations" package
    "
      flutter_localizations:
        sdk: flutter

      intl: ^0.19.0
    "
- then import
    import 'package:flutter_localizations/flutter_localizations.dart';
- After introducing the flutter_localizations package and adding the previous code,
  the "Material" and "Cupertino" packages should now be correctly localized in one of
  the 115 supported locales. Widgets should be adapted to the localized messages,
  along with correct left-to-right or right-to-left layout.
